# Poker preflop simulator
## Introduction and Purpose:
Have you ever thought of whether you should fold given a controversic hand, or maybe you felt the thrill and wanted to raise the pot with some suited connectors? But you never really knew what are the **odds of winning**?

Sometimes (most of the times tbh) for ***amateur*** players it doesn't really matter what are the exact odds - they just go with their gut and in the worst case scenario they think "Ah, its still fine, I'm gonna bluff this out...".

This application will help you feel the game better. It probably will not make a difference in live game, but you can check what were the odds of you winning that silly hand afterwards and be less (or more xd) dissapointed about it.
>***DISCLAIMER*** - *NEVER CHEAT IN LIVE EVENTS* (or anywhere else lol)
